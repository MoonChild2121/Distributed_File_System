A distributed file system is a computer file system that allows the storage of data on multiple computers linked by a network. This file system, also known as a distributed storage system, is used to securely, efficiently, and reliably store, access, and manage large volumes of files.

File systems are essential components of any business because they allow for the storage and retrieval of data. Distributed file systems, on the other hand, provide a distinct set of advantages that make them an essential component of any organizationâ€™s infrastructure. As a result, organizations can reduce costs while increasing storage capacity and performance by implementing a distributed file system.
